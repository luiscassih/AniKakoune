# AniMotion.nvim
A Neovim plugin that implements selection-first text editing, similar to Helix and Kakoune editors. Lets you see your selection as you travel, allowing quick operations like change, delete, or yank. Works in normal mode with configurable selection modes.

## Installation
> Lazy basic defaults to "helix" mode
```lua
return {
  "luiscassih/AniMotion.nvim",
  event = "VeryLazy",
  config = true
}
```
> Default config
```lua
require("AniMotion").setup({
  mode = "helix", -- "nvim" or "animotion"
  word_keys = {
    [Utils.Targets.NextWordStart] = "w",
    [Utils.Targets.NextWordEnd] = "e",
    [Utils.Targets.PrevWordStart] = "b",
    [Utils.Targets.NextLongWordStart] = "W",
    [Utils.Targets.NextLongWordEnd] = "E",
    [Utils.Targets.PrevLongWordStart] = "B",
  }, -- you can get the targets by local Utils = require("Animotion.Utils")
  edit_keys = { "c", "d", "s", "r", "y" }, -- you can add "p" if you want.
  clear_keys = { "<Esc>" } -- used when you want to deselect/exit from SEL mode.
  marks = {"y", "z"}, -- Is a mark used internally in this plugin, when we do a visual select when changing or deleting the highlighted word.
  map_visual = true, -- When true, we capture "v" and pressing it will enter visual mode with the plugin selection as part of the visual selection. When false, pressing "v" will exit SEL mode and the selection will be lost. You want to set to false if you have trouble with other mappings associated to "v". I recommend to try in true first.
  color = { bg = "#673AB7" } -- put color = "Visual" to use the default visual mode color.
})
```

> For lualine users

You can have something like this to show an indicator if the plugin is in use.
```lua
ins_left {
  function()
    if (require("AniMotion").isActive()) then
      return "â—Ž SEL"
    end
    return ""
  end,
  color = { fg = colors.red, gui = 'bold' },
}
```

## Diferent modes

> helix - default

In this mode, word motions keys will behave helix (or kakoune), it's a bit different than neovim, for example pressing `w` on a word will go up until we hit a non whitespace character. In `Hello world`, pressing at `H` will move the cursor to the space and will select `Hello `.

> nvim

In this mode, word motions keys will behave the same as neovim, pressing `w` will go to the first character of the next word. In `Hello world`, pressing at `H` will move the cursor to `w` and will select `Hello w`. <br/>
You probably will not want to use this mode unless you're so used with the default `w` behavior of neovim and only want to enable the "select first" approach.

> animotion

This is my personal mode, for `w` and `b`, instead of highlighting spaces and punctuation characters, it's selects words by words. For example, in `vim.keymap.set("a"`, w will select `vim`, w again `keymap`, w again `set`, w again `a`. I find this approach to be more productive. The rest of jumps `e` `E` will go to helix mode, and `W` `B` will also go to helix mode but with the short jump instead. `W` will behave as `w` and `B` as `b` with helix mode.

So, this mode is an hybrid helix with a custom `w` `b`. The mind approach for this mode is: "Most of the time I only want to change words, so I keep pressing `w`, if I need to change punctuation, I press `W`"

## Motivation and reason of existence

I love neovim and I can't imagine coding without it anymore, but saying that, I was intrigued by the visual selection-first approach of helix and kakoune, but I didn't wanted to spend so much time getting used to their keybinds and using vim keybinds plugin in Helix didn't feel right, so I decided to make this plugin.

The main feature I was using and liked from helix was the selection navigation used with `w` and `b`, while in vim we have `viw` which is great, but navigating and then changing words fast with helix felt more natural. So bringing this motion was the main motivation for this plugin. As for the other motions, I didn't see the need, as neovim motion cover all of them pretty naturally. Want to select a paragraph? `vip`, same with block, quotes, up to a character, and go on, I didn't see the need to change them.

After playing with helix mode in `w` and `b`, I noticed that what I really wanted is to hop by words over and over, and while helix does that, it also select spaces and hop between punctuation. What I mean is, a pretty common code is to have `object.function()` or `pointer->member`, on most cases of editing portion of code like these, you usually want to change the name of the function, member or object, you don't usually want to change the punctuation, so jumping at each `.` or `->` or `(` feels a waste of motions. In `Object.getInstance().function()` I have to press `w` 5 times to get to `function` while with `animotion` you need to press 3 times, doesn't look so different, but in practice it made much difference and feels more natural to travel this way. And in case you need to still jump within punctuation, you can press with shift, so `W` and will behave the same as helix, having both worlds.

## Notes
- This plugin works using the normal mode, so any key you press not captured by this plugin, it will behave normally. For example, if you have `K` mapped to lsp hover, even if you have any word selected using `w` (so in SEL mode), pressing `K` will show the hover normally.
